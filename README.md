# ng-key-enter

ng-key-enter allow us to pass a function in on an enter key to do what we want for AngularJS

## Why this?

AngularJS doesn’t have an easily alternative.

## Usage

Include `ng-key-enter.js` in your HTML document somewhere after you have set
up AngularJS.

```html
<script src="ng-key-enter.js">`
```

Make sure that `ng-key-enter` is a dependency in your AngularJS app.

```js
angular.module("myApp", ["ngKeyEnter"]);
```

### Directive

Use easily this way. The directive accepts a function.

```html
<input type="text" ng-model="your.model" ng-key-enter="hello()" />
```
```js
$scope.hello() = function() {
	alert('Hello World');
};
```
